<center><h1>Chapter 1: The Wish that went Wrong</h1></center>
<center><p style="font-size: 20px;">Tara was a kind, curious 10-year-old who loved to explore the woods near her village. She didn’t have many friends, but animals seemed to like her. She would often leave out bits of bread for birds, talk to squirrels, and pet every friendly dog she saw.
One afternoon, she was walking along a winding trail when she heard a soft cry. She followed the sound and found a tiny squirrel stuck in a rusty metal trap.
“Oh no!” she gasped.</p></center>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px;">Carefully, she pried open the trap and freed the frightened squirrel. As soon as she let go, the squirrel turned and stared at her with shiny eyes. “Thank you,” it squeaked — in perfect English. Tara blinked. “Did… you just talk?” The squirrel nodded. “You have a kind heart. Follow me.” Too surprised to question, she followed it deeper into the forest. Soon they arrived at a vine-covered wooden gate with golden letters carved on top:<br/><b>"Forest of Wishes – Only for the Kind-Hearted."</b></p></center>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px;">The gate creaked open magically. Inside, the forest shimmered — trees glowed with gentle light, and streams sparkled like silver ribbons. Birds chirped melodies that sounded like songs.
A tall, wise-looking owl fluttered down from a branch.
“Welcome, Tara,” the owl said. “You have shown kindness without expecting anything in return. For that, the Forest of Wishes offers you one wish. Choose wisely.”<br/>
Tara’s eyes widened. A wish? Anything?<br>
She thought hard, then said excitedly, “I wish to be the smartest person in the world! Then I can solve problems, win awards, and everyone will listen to me!”
The owl nodded once and said, “So it shall be.”</p></center>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px;">In an instant, her mind exploded with knowledge — languages, math, music, history, even the thoughts of people nearby. But instead of feeling proud… she felt dizzy.
She heard everything. Her brain buzzed with too much information. She couldn’t focus. She couldn’t enjoy anything.
Tears welled up in her eyes. “This isn’t what I wanted,” she whispered. “It’s too much…”</p></center>
