“Please take it back,” she begged. “I don’t want to be the smartest anymore.”
The owl shook his head gently. “A wish cannot be undone,” he said. “But it can be outgrown. You must now complete three acts of kindness — but you cannot use your new knowledge. Only your heart.”
Tara wiped her tears and nodded.</p></center>

“I lost my way home,” said the fox. “I don’t remember the path.”
Tara could have used her knowledge of<br/> geography or forest mapping, but instead, she just sat with the fox, gently asked questions, and remembered the scent of pine trees where she had seen foxes before.
Together, they found the den, and the mother fox licked Tara’s hand gratefully.</p></center>

Tara knelt beside it and instead of reciting facts about storms or safety, she held the deer close and softly sang a lullaby her mother used to sing. The deer’s breathing slowed, and it fell asleep peacefully.</p></center>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>&#127753;Third task:</b>A family of turtles was stuck by a flowing stream, unable to cross. Tara saw a pile of fallen sticks. Instead of calculating angles or complex bridges, she used trial and error to build a simple wooden path with care and patience.
The turtles safely crossed and smiled gratefully.
With each act, the voices in her mind grew quieter. The noise faded. And for the first time since her wish, Tara smiled — truly smiled.
